-Card game
-Cards are two-sided
-Deck is assembled along the way
-New deck each run
-Just classic Slay the Spire approach (no additional genres)
-Setting: fantasy (you are a mage and cards are spells)

-Two sides of cards represent different play styles:
-1 - More defensive, 2 - More offensive
-1 - Light side, 2 - Dark side
-Each card has multiple uses
-You can win by using only one strategy/side, as well as both
-As many synergies as possible
